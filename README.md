# Demo: ATT Friend Manager

**NOTE: this repository requires updating. It currently is not functional, and does not make use of the latest js-tale SSO tech**

This simple demo requires a user to login via their Alta account, and then presents them with a list of their friends.

It is built with create-react-app, with a live demo provided by pages.github.com.
